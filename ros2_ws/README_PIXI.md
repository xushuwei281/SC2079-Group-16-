# Pixi-ROS Workspace

This ROS jazzy workspace is configured to use [Pixi](https://pixi.sh) for dependency management.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pixi install
```

### 2. Build the workspace

```bash
pixi run build
```

### 3. Run tests

```bash
pixi run test
```

### 4. Activate the environment

```bash
pixi shell
```

This starts a new shell with the ROS environment activated. You can also prefix any command
with `pixi run <command>` without entering the shell.

> **Note:** After the first `pixi run build`, pixi will automatically source
> `install/setup.bash` on environment activation. This means all your built packages
> are available without any manual sourcing.

## Adding dependencies

When you add dependencies to your `package.xml` files, re-run `pixi ros init` to update `pixi.toml`:

```bash
pixi ros init --distro jazzy
```

To add a conda package directly:

```bash
pixi add <package-name>
```

To add a PyPI package:

```bash
pixi add --pypi <package-name>
```

## Unavailable packages

If `pixi.toml` contains commented-out lines marked `# NOT FOUND`, those packages could not be
resolved from the default channels. Options:

1. **Use a custom channel** — re-run init with `--channel` if the package lives elsewhere:
   ```bash
   pixi ros init --distro jazzy --channel https://prefix.dev/my-channel
   ```
2. **Add the channel manually** — `pixi project channel add <channel-url>`
3. **Check the package name** — verify spelling in your `package.xml`
4. **Install via PyPI** — `pixi add --pypi <package-name>`
5. **Contribute to RoboStack** — if the package is missing from the default ROS channel:
   - [ros-humble](https://github.com/RoboStack/ros-humble)
   - [ros-jazzy](https://github.com/RoboStack/ros-jazzy)
   - [ros-kilted](https://github.com/RoboStack/ros-kilted)

## Common issues

### Build fails

1. Make sure all dependencies are installed: `pixi install`
2. Clean and rebuild: `pixi run clean && pixi run build`

### `ros2` commands not found

Run commands through pixi: `pixi run <command>` or enter the shell with `pixi shell`.

### Active ROS environment conflict

If `pixi ros init` warns about an "Active ROS environment detected", you have a ROS installation
sourced in your shell. Remove or comment out any lines like the following from `~/.bashrc` or
`~/.zshrc` and restart your shell:

```bash
# source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
# source ~/ros_ws/install/setup.bash
```

Pixi manages the ROS environment automatically — no manual sourcing needed.
